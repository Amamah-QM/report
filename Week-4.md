### Task Summary
In my fourth week, I was tasked with searching for AI tools that could increase the productivity of the Lusail Team by taking over mundane, repetitive tasks, for example. This had been an ongoing exploration since my first week and it was finally time to bring it all together.

Initially, I had been asked to look into transcription tools for online meetings. MS Teams already had a feature that allowed transcription (using another app called Stream) that I was asked to test out but I did not have access to that feature, so I began looking into external tools that performed the same function.

In parallel, I also looked into other functions AI could perform. Content generation was a disqualified category due to instances of fake content generation ("AI hallucination"), so I looked into the automation of tasks, like making presentations or having to type out the same type of email several times. These are tasks that need to be done but are simple enough that they could be automated, in theory.

Additionally, I also looked into secretarial tools that would help individuals keep track of their schedules, assist with to-do list items and help with writing by performing grammar and spelling checks.

### Tools
To discuss my findings, I've divided the categories into the following: auto-transcription, automation and tools to explore further.

#### Auto-transcription
As mentioned earlier, I did not have access to the transcription service on Stream until this week, so in the meantime, I explored tools like Tl;dv and Airgram. They are both apps that can generate transcripts for online meetings, alongside meeting minutes and tags. It is also possible to upload meeting recordings and perform the same functions for them. They also had additional features like scheduling meetings on Teams and joining the scheduled meetings automatically to start note-taking automatically. Tl;dv, unfortunately, did not have the option for Teams integration, so it had to be discarded. Airgram seemed like a better fit.

Then I had the opportunity to test the Stream transcript generation feature and much simpler to use, in terms of not requiring any additional installation and being available to all team members already. The generation itself was just a matter of a few clicks and did not require any pre-requisite knowledge of programming, making it the obvious best choice.

#### Automation using Power Automate

### Challenges
I ran into multiple issues making the pages go live. I am unsure why these issues keep happening but I suspect it has to do with upload delay because the changes I make appear eventually. It is a bit nerve-wracking not to see the effect my edits have, as my experience with GitHub is limited and I am not as confident as I would like to be with making the edits I have to. This leads to a lot of waiting for the changes to appear, which is ineffective. The consistent work on GitHub is extremely helpful in dealing with that. The more I work on GitHub, the more confident I become.

On a more light-hearted note, I also learned I have limited artistic skill in customizing colors. This is not as much of a limitation as indecisiveness affecting me. I have a hard time imagining what the different combinations would look like, but waiting for the changes to happen takes a few hours, so I have to make decisions based on limited information, which can lead to some humorous - and disastrous - combinations.

### Conclusion
Overall, I personally consider this task a success because I made massive strides in becoming more comfortable with GitHub. I was simultaneously working on making a better version of my blog alongside the audio guide, and I finished it this week. It is quite simplistic but it is a point of pride for me.

Additionally, I continued my search for AI tools the team can use to increase productivity. I decided to focus on tools that can perform secretarial tasks, as they would be easiest to implement and should theoretically be more user-friendly.

I have learned a lot in the short time I've been here and I am looking forward to what I will be able to do as I progress with this internship.
