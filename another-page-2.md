### Task Summary
In my second week, I was tasked with creating a prototype audio guide for the exhibits at Lusail Museum. I was asked to fork the repository from ACMI and edit it to suit the collection at Lusail Museum. The final product can be found here: [Lusail Museum Audio Guide](https://amamah-qm.github.io/welcome)

These codes can be scanned to access each individual stop:

The objective was to improve my skills gradually. I had to make an audio guide in English first, then in Arabic and then make one with a video incorporated into it. I was able to make the English audio guide with relative ease. I was able to make the Arabic guide go live next, but it took a bit longer than expected. I am unsure why it took the time it did, but the Arabic guide was functional.

Finally, I worked on the video guide. It was a challenge to compress the video enough to upload it to the repository. Once I got around that, I had to figure out how to make the video appear. It took me some time but I found a way to make the video load on the page, and the whole guide was then complete.

### Challenges
I ran into multiple issues making the pages go live. I am unsure why these issues keep happening but I suspect it has to do with upload delay because the changes I make appear eventually. It is a bit nerve-wracking not to see the effect my edits have, as my experience with GitHub is limited and I am not as confident as I would like to be with making the edits I have to. This leads to a lot of waiting for the changes to appear, which is ineffective. The consistent work on GitHub is extremely helpful in dealing with that. The more I work on GitHub, the more confident I become.

On a more light-hearted note, I also learned I have limited artistic skill in customizing colors. This is not as much of a limitation as indecisiveness affecting me. I have a hard time imagining what the different combinations would look like, but waiting for the changes to happen takes a few hours, so I have to make decisions based on limited information, which can lead to some humorous - and disastrous - combinations.

### Conclusion
Overall, I personally consider this task a success because I made massive strides in becoming more comfortable with GitHub. I was simultaneously working on making a better version of my blog alongside the audio guide, and I finished it this week. It is quite simplistic but it is a point of pride for me.

Additionally, I continued my search for AI tools the team can use to increase productivity. I decided to focus on tools that can perform secretarial tasks, as they would be easiest to implement and should theoretically be more user-friendly.

I have learned a lot in the short time I've been here and I am looking forward to what I will be able to do as I progress with this internship.
