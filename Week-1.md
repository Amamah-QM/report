### Introduction and Survey of Guests
I started the week by taking a tour of the museum, becoming familiar with my environment. I attended the weekly Lusail Team meeting and got acquainted with the people and their roles. After that, I was asked to observe the behavior of the guests at the museum. The purpose was to note what multimedia they interacted with, for how long and why.

Once I finished observation, I had to conduct surveys. The survey method was fairly straightforward; I would conduct a 1-1 interview with a guest, asking them questions from the survey and noting their responses. I was tasked with obtaining 20 survey results and I accomplished that in three days.

During the survey process, I was given a behind-the-scenes tour of the technology used at the museum, how and where it is housed and a brief rundown on how it is operated. The tour was informative and interesting, piquing my curiosity for the inner workings of different types of multimedia.

Additionally, as AI is my speciality, I was asked to find tools that may help the team increase productivity. This allows me to look into tools I would have no reason to search for on my own, broadening the knowledge I can gain in my field. My findings will be presented in an upcoming team meeting.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
Next, I had to process the data I obtained from the surveys. I chose to use Power BI, as it is a tool I have never used before and I want to take every opportunity to learn as much as I can. It took a bit of trial and error but I understood its basic functions, thereby being able to create visuals directly from the data.

Finally, I had to use GitHub to publish this report. I have never used GitHub and am fairly new to coding as a whole. It was a bit of a learning curve but by playing around with it, I managed to figure out how to make it work.

### Evaluation of Technological Concepts and Their Application to Qatar Museums
In parallel to these tasks, I was given videos to view, related to the use of innovative technology (AI or otherwise) to improve the guest experience at museums. I assessed the viability and value of these concepts to Qatar Museums and wrote a short report for each of them. The first video was regarding the use of AI to digitize and categorize entire museum collections all over the world to make them easily accessible; AI use was proposed to do the actual classification process. I believe that the real value there lies in digitizing exhibits to preserve them, rather than display them, as museums generally have a virtual version online anyway. Using AI to preserve these collections will allow future generations access to this information and these relics, even if something were to happen to them.

The second video was a behind-the-scenes tour of the ACMI museum in Australia. They used innovative technology to create the Lens: a disk that functions as a virtual diary of the guestsâ€™ visit. It allows them to store information about which exhibits they visit and then use that data to discover media outside of the museum related to their topics of interest. I believe their Lens is a great example of using multimedia to make the experience memorable and unique for the next visit.

### Conclusion
Overall, my first week has been an exciting new experience for me. As students, we always have the knowledge that a workplace is different from a university in terms of dynamics and duties. I learned that is possible to know that and still be surprised by how noticeable of a difference it is. I appreciate being given the opportunity to work in a supportive environment, related to the field I will be working in. I look forward to the coming weeks and the development they will bring.
